## What is the Project?
Depression has impacted countless people, which has increased due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Inadequate medical guidelines have caused depression to go consistently undiagnosed and untreated. Our project aims to improve current depression identification methods using supervised machine learning and NHANES data.
